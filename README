JavaEWAH

This is a word-aligned compressed variant of
the Java Bitset class. It uses a 64-bit RLE-like
compression scheme.

The goal of word-aligned compression is not to 
achieve the best compression, but rather to 
improve query processing time. Hence, we try
to save CPU cycles, maybe at the expense of
storage. However, the EWAH scheme we implemented
is always more efficient storage-wise than an
uncompressed bitmap (as implemented in the java
BitSet class by Sun).


For better performance, use a 64-bit JVM over
64-bit CPUs.
